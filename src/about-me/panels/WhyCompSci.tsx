				My primary motivation for choosing computer science is pretty simple: I really enjoy
				doing it.
			</p>
			<p>But that’s too easy so here are some specific reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It provides a challenge which feels rewarding</li>
				<li>Working on a team makes accomplishments feel more valuable</li>
				<li>There is always more to learn</li>
			</ul>
			{/* <p>
				I like the sense of belonging that comes with working on a team. Some of my most
				fond moments in life come from working with other people towards a shared goal. I
				think the main reason for this is that when you work on a team, your accomplishments
				aren’t just for yourself but for the people you’re working with too.
			</p>
			<p>
				And while there are plenty of other opportunities for teamwork in other disciplines,
				computer science is almost exclusively team-driven if you want to make anything
				large within a decent amount of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is so much to learn about computer science that I’m certain that there will
				never be a day where I can’t learn something new. I’ve spent the last 4 years + some
				of high school learning as much as I can about this field, and yet I know that I
				have only scratched the surface of even just my focus area.
			</p>
			<p>
				So while it is intimidating knowing that I’ll never know everything, that’s also
				part of the fun.
			</p>
			<p>
				Probably the biggest reason I like computer science is because, although it can be
				frustrating, it’s also really rewarding. Every program is kind of like a puzzle, and
				the more difficult the puzzle, the more fun it is when you’ve finally solved it.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s also cool to make things for other people, so seeing their reactions to the
				finished product is also really gratifying.
